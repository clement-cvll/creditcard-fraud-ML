# Context
This is a personal project to improve my machine learning, data visualisation and various other skills.

# How to execute

First the data is available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download">here<a/>. You need to download the .csv and put it in the  repository, then you need to install the **requirements.txt** (better with a virtual env.) via 

> pip install -r requirements.txt

Then you can just execute the **.ipynb** notebooks, there are three notebooks: **1. data-exploration.ipynb** for the first analysis, **2. ml-pipeline.ipynb** for the machine learning approach with scikit-learn and **3. neural-network.ipynb** for the neural network approach with tensorflow.
